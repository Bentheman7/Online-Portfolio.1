     <article class="aboutme">   
    <p> <span style ="color:blue"> I have been born and raised in California since october 2, 2000. I have attended BHUSD schools since kindergarden. My hobbies include binge watching, making really bad jokes and singing in the shower. I enjoy companions of the canine kind, churros and long walks on the beach. Some of my favorite Tv shows are Whose Line Is It Anyway, Last Week Tonight, Manhattan, Utopia and The Dennis Rodman and Friends show. I do read quite a bit, mostly spy novels. I have 2 half brothers whom have 2 stepbrothers whom have 2 half sisters. I know, its complicated and its definitely reality TV material. My 2 half brothers both are founders of Instabrand, a social media marketing company. Also i love dancing, or as more funky people call it, getting jiggy with it. </p>
